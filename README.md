# Microbial DNA as a Diagnostic Marker for Hepatocellular Carcinoma

**Goal**: To determine if algorithms from TCGA are robust on a new cohort of patients with HCC and distinguish liver tumors (HCC from non-HCC tumors)

**Hypothesis**: Tumor-associated microbial DNA can be used to classify liver tumor type

**Approach**: Use Machine Learning analysis using microbiomes as a classifier to determine cancer vs. non-cancer tissue + cancer type
